Cognostics: Metrics enabling detailed interactive visualization of big data

Multipanel display systems like Trellis Display have proven to be very effective tools for visualizing complex data sets in detail.  In Trellis Displays, data are broken into subsets and a visualization method is applied to each subset, resulting in a set of panels that are displayed in a grid, resembling a garden trellis.  When the size of the data becomes very large, it is often the case that there are too many panels for the analyst to consume at one time.  A simple idea put forth by John Tukey is to compute "cognostics", metrics that help bring different, interesting sets of panels in a display to the analyst's attention and allow the analyst to interactively sort and filter the panels.  Cognostics can include statistical summaries, descriptive variables, goodness-of-fit metrics, etc.  In this talk, I will discuss ideas regarding default cognostic choices based on what is being plotted and will discuss an implementation of a large-scale multipanel display system with cognostics called Trelliscope.
